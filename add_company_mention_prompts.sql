  * Exact matches ("Salesforce" matches "Salesforce")
  * Partial matches ("Chaos Technology" matches "Chaos.com")
  * With/without suffixes ("Sage HR" matches "Sage")
- Exclude generic mentions (e.g., "chaos in the market" is NOT a company reference)
- Consider context when matching

2. Analysis Steps:
Step 1: Extract ALL company names from the response
Step 2: Cross-reference with [[COMPANY_NAME]] and [[COMPETITORS]]
Step 3: Set outputs:
- company_mentioned: true if [[COMPANY_NAME]] is found in text
- mentioned_companies: array of matched companies in order of appearance
- rank_list: numbered list of companies if matches found (format: "1. Company A\n2. Company B"), null if no matches
- ranking_position: position of [[COMPANY_NAME]] in list (1-based), null if not found

3. Response Requirements:
- Strict JSON format
- No additional text
- Return null for rank_list if no matches found
