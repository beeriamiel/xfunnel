Here's a step-by-step transition plan to fix the SSR and auth handling issues while maintaining our RLS policies:
Phase 1: Fix Middleware and Auth Handling
Update middleware to properly handle async cookie operations
Ensure session refresh is working correctly
Keep existing RLS policies as they are (they're correct)
Phase 2: Update Client Types
Audit and update all Supabase client instances:
Server Components → createServerComponentClient
Route Handlers → createRouteHandlerClient
Client Components → createClientComponentClient
Phase 3: Fix Auth Flow Components
Update callback route to properly handle async operations
Update login/signup flows to use correct client types
Ensure protected routes are using server components correctly
Phase 4: Dashboard and Data Access
Update dashboard components to use correct client types
Ensure company selector and other data fetching components use proper SSR patterns
Keep existing RLS policies for data access
Phase 5: Testing
Test auth flows (login, signup, callback)
Test protected routes
Test data access with RLS
Test super admin functionality
