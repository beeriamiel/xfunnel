I'll help investigate the changes needed to exclude AI Overviews (google_search) metrics from the frontend while maintaining system stability. Let me analyze the components and data flow.

First, let's understand the key components and their relationships:

1. **Data Source and Processing**
From the tables schema, I see that metrics primarily come from the `response_analysis` table, where:
- `answer_engine` field indicates the source (google_search for AI Overviews)
- Data includes metrics like sentiment_score, ranking_position, company_mentioned, etc.

Let me examine the components to understand the data flow:

Let me check the engine metrics chart component to understand how it processes AI Overview data:

Read file: app/dashboard/components/engine-metrics-chart.tsx


Let me check the ICP analysis component as well:

Read file: app/dashboard/components/new-icp-analysis/index.tsx


Based on my analysis, here are the key areas that need to be modified to exclude AI Overview metrics:

1. **Engine Metrics Chart (`engine-metrics-chart.tsx`)**:
- The component uses `DB_ENGINE_MAP` to map database engine names to display names
- Currently maps 'google_search' and 'google-search' to 'aio'
- Metrics are processed in `processGroup` function which uses this mapping
- The chart displays data for all engines including AIO
- Key changes needed:
  - Remove 'google_search'/'google-search' from `DB_ENGINE_MAP`
  - Filter out AIO data in data processing functions
  - Update UI elements that reference AIO (colors, names, etc.)

2. **Source Analysis (`source-analysis/overall-citations.tsx`)**:
- Uses `ANSWER_ENGINES` constant that includes Google Search (AIO)
- Has filtering capabilities for different engines
- Processes citations and metrics by engine type
- Key changes needed:
  - Remove Google Search from `ANSWER_ENGINES`
  - Update filter logic to exclude AIO data
  - Modify chart colors and legends

3. **ICP Analysis (`new-icp-analysis/index.tsx`)**:
- Component structure suggests it processes data across different stages
- Likely needs changes in subcomponents that handle metrics
- Key changes needed:
  - Review and update data fetching in each stage component
  - Ensure metrics calculations exclude AIO data
  - Update any UI elements referencing AIO

4. **Database Considerations**:
- Data comes from `response_analysis` table
- `answer_engine` field identifies the source
- Need to ensure queries filter out 'google_search' entries

5. **Potential Impact Areas**:
- Metrics calculations and aggregations
- Chart visualizations and legends
- Filter options and UI elements
- Data fetching queries
- Type definitions and interfaces

6. **Implementation Strategy**:
1. First modify data fetching to exclude AIO:
   - Update Supabase queries to filter out 'google_search'
   - Add engine filtering in data processing functions
2. Update UI components:
   - Remove AIO from engine lists and mappings
   - Update charts to exclude AIO data
   - Modify filters and selectors
3. Update types and interfaces:
   - Remove AIO-related types
   - Update engine type definitions
4. Test for regressions:
   - Verify metrics still calculate correctly
   - Check UI renders properly
   - Ensure filters work as expected
