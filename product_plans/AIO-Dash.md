I'll help analyze and suggest changes for this feature based on your current database structure.

1. **Data Structure Changes Needed:**

A. New Tables Needed:
```sql
- ai_overview_terms
  - id
  - company_id
  - account_id
  - term
  - source (AI/MOZ/USER)
  - status (ACTIVE/ARCHIVED)
  - created_at
  - last_checked_at

- ai_overview_tracking
  - id
  - term_id (references ai_overview_terms)
  - company_id
  - account_id
  - has_ai_overview (boolean)
  - company_mentioned (boolean)
  - competitor_mentions (array of competitor IDs)
  - url
  - checked_at
  - content_snapshot (for historical comparison)
```

B. Relationships:
- `ai_overview_terms` connects to `companies` and `accounts`
- `ai_overview_tracking` connects to `ai_overview_terms`, `companies`, and `accounts`
- Can reference `competitors` table for competitor mentions

2. **Term Generation Strategy:**

A. Sources for Term Generation:
1. Company Information Sources (from your DB):
   - `main_products` from companies table
   - `product_category`
   - `industry`
   - Existing competitor names from `competitors` table
   - ICPs from `ideal_customer_profiles`
   - Existing queries from `queries` table

2. MOZ Integration:
   - Use MOZ Keyword Explorer API to:
     - Get keyword suggestions based on company products
     - Find related terms in the AI/tech space
     - Get search volume and difficulty metrics

3. AI Generation (Using your existing AI infrastructure):
   - Use company profile to generate relevant terms:
     - Industry-specific AI terms
     - Product-related AI use cases
     - Competitor-focused terms
     - Use cases based on ICPs
   - Sources to consider for AI training:
     - Existing successful queries from `queries` table
     - Successful citations from `citations` table
     - Response analyses from `response_analysis` table

The flow would be:
1. Initial term generation using company data + AI
2. Enrich/validate terms using MOZ data
3. Store in `ai_overview_terms`
4. Regular tracking stored in `ai_overview_tracking`
5. Use existing RLS patterns for security (similar to your citations/queries tables)


2️⃣ **Hybrid MOZ + AI Approach**
- Pros:
  - Better context awareness
  - Can filter for AI/tech relevance
  - More intelligent term selection
  - Can combine multiple data sources
- Cons:
  - More complex implementation
  - Slightly slower (multiple API calls)
  - Higher API costs

**Recommended Approach: Hybrid MOZ + AI**

Here's how it would work:
1. When "Generate" is clicked:
   - Pull company data (name, description, industry)
   - Pull competitor data
   - Get relevant keywords from MOZ API
   - Send to AI for filtering/enhancement

2. AI Processing would:
   - Filter keywords for AI/tech relevance
   - Add variations based on company context
   - Score terms by likelihood of appearing in AI overviews
   - Generate additional contextual terms

3. Result Processing:
   - Return top 10 most relevant terms
   - Include mix of:
     - Direct company mentions
     - Product/service terms
     - Technology terms
     - Competitor-related terms

4. UI/UX:
   - "Generate Terms" button with loading state
   - Preview of generated terms
   - Bulk approve/reject options
   - Confidence score for each term

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this approach before we move to implementation?
